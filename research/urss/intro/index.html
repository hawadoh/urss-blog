Over the coming weeks, I‚Äôll be sharing my journey into the fascinating field of quantum cryptography. There are two parts to this: ‚Äúquantum‚Äù, the strange and powerful world of quantum physics; and ‚Äúcryptography‚Äù, the science of securing information via encryption and decryption.\nLet‚Äôs start simple. Take this number: $$1984909$$ Looks random right? Here‚Äôs the challenge: can you figure out which two numbers, when multiplied together, give you this result?\nTry doing it by hand - or even with a calculator. It‚Äôs not so easy. This task is known as factoring.\nNow look at this problem: What‚Äôs $1117 \\times 1777$?\nMuch easier, right? This is just multiplication - a basic operation every computer can do almost instantly.\nThis imbalance in difficulty is the core idea behind a ‚Äúone-way function‚Äù, and it forms the backbone of most modern classical cryptography. Your online banking, secure messaging apps, even Bitcoin, rely on this very principle: easy to compute in one direction, hard to reverse.\nState-of-the-art classical cryptographic schemes, such as RSA and elliptic-curve cryptography, are built on one-way functions involving extremely large numbers that are hundreds or even thousands of digits long. The security comes from the fact that, with today‚Äôs classical computers, reversing these operations (like factoring large numbers or solving the elliptic-curve discrete logarithm problem) would take an impractically long time (millions of years in some cases).\nAnother critical tool in modern cryptography is the hash function, such as SHA-256. Hashing is not used for encryption, but for verifying data integrity by ensuring that files, passwords, or messages haven‚Äôt been tampered with. You‚Äôll find it everywhere from password storage to blockchain mining.\nAll of these tools come together in the protocols that protect your data online - like HTTPS, which secures your connection when you visit websites. It‚Äôs what keeps others from intercepting your data on public Wi-Fi, stealing your credit card details during online shopping, or spying on your messages and personal information. Without it, everyday activities like logging into your bank, checking your email, or even just browsing would be dangerously exposed.\nBut that‚Äôs only true in a classical world. What happens when this imbalance - the fact that some problems are easy to do, but hard to undo - no longer holds?\nEnter quantum computers - machines that operate on principles of quantum mechanics rather than classical physics. Unlike regular bits that are either 0 or 1, quantum bits (or qubits) can exist in superpositions of both. This gives quantum computers access to computational shortcuts that classical machines simply can‚Äôt exploit.\nOne of the most famous quantum algorithms - Shor‚Äôs algorithm - can factor large numbers exponentially faster than any known classical method. That means our ‚Äúhard to reverse‚Äù assumption breaks down entirely. A powerful enough quantum computer could crack many classical encryption systems in hours or even minutes.\nThat‚Äôs where my research comes in. A natural response to the quantum threat is to use even harder mathematical problems. But this quickly turns into an endless arms race where quantum computers may eventually win.\nInstead of relying on increasingly complex maths that could still be broken, I‚Äôm exploring a fundamentally different approach:\nWhat if we build security from the laws of quantum physics themselves?\nThis is the central idea of quantum cryptography. It protects data not with mathematical difficulty, but with the unbreakable principles of how reality works.\nThis project is supervised by Dr Matthias C. Caro, whose insight and support have been invaluable as I explore the intersection of quantum theory and cryptographic security.\nI‚Äôm focusing on quantum-native protocols that assume quantum physics is fundamentally correct (which, based on decades of experiments, is a very safe bet).\nIf we can harness these principles properly, we could build cryptographic systems that remain secure no matter how powerful future computers become.\nIf you‚Äôve made it this far, thank you for reading.\nFrom this point on, I‚Äôll assume familiarity with undergraduate-level mathematics. We‚Äôll mostly be working with linear algebra and basic probability theory, which form the language of quantum mechanics.\nAs I‚Äôve come to realise, trying to fully understand the ideas behind quantum cryptography without engaging with the maths often ends up more confusing than helpful. The maths isn‚Äôt just technical detail; it is the anchor for intuition.\nThat said, I‚Äôll do my best to include clear numerical examples so you don‚Äôt drown in a sea of Greek letters.\nIn the next posts, I‚Äôll walk through the core building blocks of quantum cryptography, starting from the mathematical and physical foundations and building up to real protocols:\nQubits and measurement: Pure states, superposition, the Hadamard basis, standard basis measurements, post-measurement states, and the no-cloning theorem Quantum formalism: Mixed states, density matrices, partial trace, POVMs, Kraus operators, and the Bloch sphere Information and security: Trace distance, fidelity, entropy (Shannon, min-, conditional, smoothed), and the uncertainty principle via guessing games Entanglement and its power: EPR pairs, Schmidt decomposition, purifications, Bell nonlocality (using the CHSH game), and the monogamy of entanglement Quantum cryptographic primitives: Quantum one-time pad (OTP) and secret sharing Privacy amplification: Extracting uniform randomness using two-universal hash functions and strong seeded extractors Key distribution theory: $\\varepsilon$-correctness, $\\varepsilon$-secrecy, information reconciliation, and classical authenticated channels (CAC) Quantum key distribution protocols: BB'84 and its purified variant, along with a sketch of their security and correctness proofs More coming soon... These posts will be based on Chapters 1 to 8 (excluding Chapter 3) from the textbook Introduction to Quantum Cryptography, and my own understanding. I‚Äôll aim to make each concept as intuitive and self-contained as possible while gradually building toward more advanced ideas. All credit for the textbook content goes to Thomas Vidick and Stephanie Wehner, the authors of the textbook.\nAfter that, if time allows, I‚Äôll also explore how these quantum cryptographic protocols could be applied in real-world systems, using blockchain platforms like Bitcoin and Ethereum as a case study.\nLet‚Äôs build trust from the laws of the universe.\n","wordCount":"990","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2025-06-24T16:10:31+01:00","dateModified":"2025-06-24T16:10:31+01:00","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Howard Cheung"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://teaegg.net/research/urss/intro/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"ùóßùóòùóî‚Ä¢ùóòùóöùóö","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://teaegg.net/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://teaegg.net/ accesskey=h title=Home>ùóßùóòùóî‚Ä¢ùóòùóöùóö</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="Toggle theme" aria-label="Toggle theme">
